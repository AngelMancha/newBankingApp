# Banking Application

## Description

This application allows users to manage their banking transactions. Users can upload a file with transaction history, view and filter transactions, and generate statistics. Key features include:

- **Merge Payments**: Users can merge multiple payments into a single entry. For example, if you paid $200 for dinner but received $100 from your friends via Bizum, you can merge these transactions into a single entry showing a net expense of $100. This feature helps to consolidate transactions, making it easier to manage and understand your expenses.

- **Update Tag**: Users can update the tag of a transaction to better categorize their expenses.
